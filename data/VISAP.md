**Winds Through Time: Interactive Data Visualization and Physicalization for Paleoclimate Communication** — We describe a multidisciplinary collaboration to iteratively design an interactive exhibit for a public science center on paleoclimate, the study of past climates. We created a data physicalisation of mountains and ice sheets that can be tangibly manipulated by visitors to interact with a wind simulation visualisation that demonstrates how the climate of North America differed dramatically between now and the peak of the last ice age. We detail the system for interaction and visualisation plus design choices to appeal to an audience that ranges from children to scientists and responds to site requirements.
**Psychomare: A Psychoanalytic and XR-Based Artistic Exploration into Nightmare Visualization** — Psychomare is an artistic research project that explores the visualization of nightmares through a psychoanalytic and XR-based performance methodology. By treating dreams as symbolic data and nightmares as distortions of subjective recognition, the project translates psychological fear into tangible visual forms. Utilizing AI-driven imagery, embodied dance performance, and virtual production technologies, Psychomare creates an immersive dream-scape where the dancer confronts surreal nightmare entities derived from personal and collective dream memories. Drawing on Lacanian theory, the work proposes that nightmares emerge from a mis-recognition of the self—a mirrored distortion of unconscious desires and fears projected onto dream imagery. This symbolic mis-recognition becomes the conceptual core of the project, guiding its aesthetic and choreographic strategies. Feedback from the dancer, audience, and a psychoanalyst reveals strong emotional resonance and aesthetic depth, suggesting that the visualization of nightmares can foster self-reflection, emotional confrontation, and collective empathy. This project offers a new model for integrating immersive art, psychoanalytic theory, and technological mediation as a path of collective care.
**Rejecting Colonial Practices in Data Storytelling** — Given the difficulties and inherent problems of data, how do we approach data representations in a decolonial way? This annotated portfolio by Kontinentalist illustrates our evolving practice and attempt at forging a path grounded in a community manifesto that looks to challenge the need for accuracy and certainty, centring design in Indigenous vernacular and knowledge, and challenging reductivism.
**Tides of Memory: Digital Echoes of Netizen Remembrance** — This research explores how collective mourning unfolds on digital platforms and how ephemeral online expressions can be preserved through visualization. Drawing on Sina Weibo posts following the deaths of seven Chinese authors since 2016, it collected tens of thousands of mourning messages and applied web scraping, natural language processing, and 3D modeling to transform unstructured textual data into interactive spatial monuments. The analysis used word frequency measures, TF-IDF feature extraction, and topic modeling to identify thematic clusters and emotional vocabularies within commemorative discourse, while statistical standardization and nonlinear transformation were introduced to balance disparities in data volume and enable meaningful comparisons across authors. A central feature of the visualization lies in the structure of the monuments: the lower segment symbolizes the author’s lifetime creative legacy, and the upper segment reflects collective remembrance through the intensity of public mourning expressed in netizens’ posts and hashtags. This dual-layer design creates a dialogue between personal creation and communal commemoration, turning fragmented and short-lived online expressions into a tangible and immersive memorial. By materializing collective grief as spatialized memory, this research offers new methods for studying digital mourning practices and provides a model for preserving cultural remembrance in the networked age.
**Tides of Memory Digital Echoes of Netizen Remembrance** — The installation transforms online mourning into immersive monuments by drawing on Sina Weibo posts written after the deaths of seven Chinese authors since 2016 and translating fragmented emotions into three-dimensional commemorative forms through the integration of data collection, natural language processing, and 3D modeling. It presents monuments composed of two layers that create a dialogue between individual creativity and collective memory, with the lower half symbolizing an author’s lifetime creative legacy and the upper half reflecting public remembrance through netizens’ mourning words, hashtags, and emotional expressions. It situates these monuments along a “Path of Remembrance,” a solemn digital corridor that evokes the atmosphere of walking through a memorial, and it further encourages interaction by allowing viewers to explore high-frequency keywords, revisit original posts, and contribute personal tributes that expand the archive of grief. It transforms fleeting and fragmented online words into a shared cultural memory, materializes ephemeral emotions into tangible structures, bridges personal sorrow with collective resonance, and highlights the enduring bond between readers and writers by showing how netizens’ voices now commemorate those who once shaped language. The installation reimagines mourning rituals for the digital age and creates a poetic and participatory space where memory, text, and community converge.
**The Damaged Leaf Herbarium and Dataset** — The Damaged Leaf Herbarium and Dataset is comprised of over 10,000 Vermont leaves scarred by Lymantria dispar caterpillars during the devastating outbreaks of 2021 and 2022 in Colchester, Vermont. The outbreak left the artist's neighborhood trees defoliated in early spring, and for two seasons Karson collected their fallen leaves on walks ritualized by the pandemic. Sculpted by the caterpillars' eating patterns into enchanting forms—both creations and ruins, horrible and beautiful—the leaves symbolize disruptive consumption and fantastical flora, fauna, and funga interspecies entanglements with humans and technology. With a team of students over the past four years, Karson engaged in a collective care for the leaves that involved cleaning, pressing, preserving, and photography. Their work includes training algorithms to be caretakers of the leaves. By avoiding the dominant narrative that typically vilifies L. dispar as an invasive species in North America, this work reveals the fable of a phantom silk moth. The story begins when an entrepreneurial 19th-century entomologist, motivated by the wealth of the silk industry, attempted to innovate a new breed of silkworm—his experiment failed spectacularly.
**The Knowledge Cosmos: An Immersive Platform for Interdisciplinary  Research Discovery** — As the volume of scientific literature continues to expand exponentially, traditional research tools struggle to keep pace—often reinforcing disciplinary silos and limiting opportunities for discovery. The Knowledge Cosmos re-imagines research exploration through an interactive, 3D visualization platform that treats science not as a static repository, but as a navigable universe. By spatializing 17 million academic papers based on semantic similarity, the platform enables users to explore the structure of knowledge intuitively, uncover interdisciplinary connections, and identify underexplored intellectual gaps. Drawing on the principles of play, immersion, and serendipity, The Knowledge Cosmos democratizes the bird’s eye view of research and encourages curiosity-driven inquiry across a wide range of users including students, educators, independent thinkers, and lifelong learners.

**Simulacra Naturae: Generative Ecosystem driven by Agent-Based Simulations and Brain Organoid Collective Intelligence** — Simulacra Naturae is a data-driven media installation that explores collective care through the entanglement of biological computation, material ecologies, and generative systems. The work translates pre-recorded neural activity from brain organoids, lab-grown three-dimensional clusters of neurons, into a multi-sensory environment composed of generative visuals, spatial audio, living plants, and fabricated clay artifacts. These biosignals, streamed through a real-time system, modulate emergent agent behaviors inspired by natural systems such as termite colonies and slime molds. Rather than using biosignals as direct control inputs, Simulacra Naturae treats organoid activity as a co-creative force, allowing neural rhythms to guide the growth, form, and atmosphere of a generative ecosystem. The installation features computationally fabricated clay prints embedded with solenoids, adding physical sound resonances to the generative surround composition. The spatial environment, filled with live tropical plants and a floor-level projection layer featuring real-time generative AI visuals, invites participants into a sensory field shaped by nonhuman cognition. By grounding abstract data in living materials and embodied experience, Simulacra Naturae reimagines visualization as a practice of care, one that decentralizes human agency and opens new spaces for ethics, empathy, and ecological attunement within hybrid computational systems.
**Simulacra Naturae Generative Forms from Agent-Based Ecosystems with Organoid Collective Intelligence** — Simulacra Naturae is a collaborative media installation exploring the entanglement of digital morphogenesis and the interplay between biological and artificial intelligences. Brain organoids drive simulations of agent-based ecosystems such as flocks, slime molds, and termites. Their spontaneous neural activity modulates the behavior of these agents, influencing real-time generative visuals, spatial sound, sculptural forms, and living plants within the installation. By merging neural data, algorithmic growth, and material fabrication, Simulacra Naturae creates a hybrid ecosystem where cognition and agency emerge through co-evolving interactions between code, matter, and living systems. This mediated environment invites reflection on synthetic ecologies, distributed intelligence, and the blurred boundaries between simulation and sensation.
**The Secret Life of... Collective Plastic Microfibre Traces** — Data are crucial for showcasing the effects of environmental crises and visualising potential future developments to drive change; however, data visualisations like infographics, pie charts, and histograms can be difficult for people to relate to and inspire change. The Secret Life of... is an interactive installation that transforms environmental data into acts of embodied engagement, reflective inquiry, and collective care. The installation helps visualise the invisible environmental impact of plastic microfibre emissions through methods that prioritise relational understanding, empathy, and participatory meaning-making. These methods allow us to relate data to everyday actions (e.g., how do you recognise plastic microfibre in your garments?) and objects (e.g., what is the composition of the garment you are currently wearing?) in accessible and meaningful ways. The installation was first shown at the Fashion for Future event at Free University of Bozen-Bolzano (Italy) in April 2024, and then at Circular Week Tyrol in Innsbruck (Austria) in September 2024. Following this year's conference theme on "Collective Care", for this event, we proposed three intertwined experiences that invite participants to reflect on the invisible microplastics released from our garments: (1) a guided sensorial exploration, (2) a collective mapping of microfibres, and (3) an interactive drawing experience with projections. Participants are guided through these activities to observe and identify different fibre types, collect them from the surface of their garments, and visualize them collectively. Through these experiences, additional context is provided on the design process, scientific grounding, and aesthetic choices. This creates space for questions, dialogic encounters, and shared reflections on how data can be experienced as an act of both collective and individual care.
**Empathic Growth** — Empathic Growth is an interspecies interactive installation exploring plant perception through Jakob von Uexküll's "Umwelt" concept. It visualizes human Galvanic Skin Response (GSR) data and plant biosignals in a shared environment, creating cross-species empathy. Inspired by Ursula K. Le Guin's Changing Planes: one plane features humans with plant DNA; another shares dreams telepathically. Using supervised learning, the work transforms human-plant signals into sentient hybrid forms—agent-based artificial life live in virtual space, exploring collective consciousness.
**Kaleidoscope of Thoughts: Experimental Visualization of Cognitive Turbulence** — Kaleidoscope of Thoughts is a 360° immersive media installation that visualizes the complexity of human cognition and emotion through participatory storytelling. Built from over forty voice notes and reflections in fifteen languages, including American Sign Language. The work translates raw thoughts into a layered audiovisual journey. Voices overlap, refract, and evolve across a 55-speaker spatial sound system, enveloping visitors in a sonic tapestry of worry, gratitude, aspiration, and hope. The visual environment, designed in TouchDesigner, unfolds as a seven-minute sequence of pre-rendered generative forms and symbolic textures. Cyanotype imprints evoke memory and personal history, while noise patterns and distorted text externalize mental turbulence. Algorithmic tunnels inspired by the Fibonacci sequence trace nonlinear pathways of thought, punctuated by animated clusters representing shifting emotions. The “thought bubbles” illustrate clarity and optimism, and the installation culminates in a dynamically animated Lorenz attractor, the Butterfly Effect, symbolizing how even the smallest shift in perspective can spark transformation. At the center of the installation stands a custom-built mirrored kaleidoscope, multiplying reflections of both visuals and audience members. This sculptural form emphasizes the interconnectedness of personal and collective experience, inviting participants to see themselves as integral to the evolving narrative. By weaving together sound, light, and projection mapping with contributions from diverse communities, Kaleidoscope of Thoughts fosters empathy, reflection, and collective care. It offers more than a visualization of mental processes, it is a contemplative environment where individual voices merge into a shared landscape of resilience, reminding us that subtle changes in thought can open profound possibilities for connection and healing.
**A Walled City** — A Walled City is an interactive AI installation that transforms personal and collective visual memories into a decentralized, evolving virtual city. Grounded in the spatial logic, zoning, and aesthetics of the historical Kowloon Walled City (Hongkong), a self-built hyper-dense enclave that grew in a legal and political void from the 1950s to 1993, the work builds a multi-agent AI system to turn participant-uploaded images into architectural chambers, forming a living structure where data, memory, and historical urban logic converge. The project is not nostalgic; rather, it reflects on density, proximity, and how private fragments can be reassembled into shared space. Each contribution remains visible as itself, yet becomes part of a larger organism that accumulates, shifts, and evolves over time. In A Walled City, memory becomes architecture, identity is spatialized, and communities emerge through a rhizomatic network. The work connects AI systems with historical urban memory, turning contributions into forms and forms into relations, while raising the question of what is protected by “walls” and what is kept apart in the worldbuilding of future settlement.
**You Only Have Seven Seconds: From Intimate Whispers to Shared Worlds in Participatory Data-Driven Cinematic Art** — You Only Have Seven Seconds is a cinematic artistic visualization derived from an interactive AI art installation (ReCollection) that explores how machine intelligence can reassemble collective human memory through language input. Motivated by the artist’s personal response to her grandmother’s cognitive decline and informed by current research in Critical Dementia Studies that advocates for reimagining—rather than repairing—memory, the project collects and curates whispered, seven-second recollections and machine-generated image data from installation participants. These selected datasets are transformed into a generative visualization presented as a cinematic art using custom-designed AI systems and experimental visualization strategies. This paper introduces the conceptual foundations and technical development of this project, with emphasis on data collection, experimental visualization, narrative construction, sound design, and intelligent system integration. Through the design of artificial memory, You Only Have Seven Seconds constructs a dynamic archive of shared, ephemeral recollections for storytelling.

Drawing from feminist technoscience and post-anthropocentric design, it investigates synthetic residues as part of an invisible ecology of exposure, one that extends from the laboratory bench to planetary metabolism. Six micro-residue samples were collected at a university FabLab in São Paulo, Brazil, and scanned with a Vega LMU Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM). The materials included RenShape, PLA coated with automotive spray paint, PMMA, carbon fiber bound with epoxy resin, and MDF. The resulting electron textures were paired with sonified image data and multilingual vocal recitations of their chemical components, generating an affective archive of matter and sound. The title of the work acts as a performed material archive—a litany of estimated substances present in the samples. Recited rhythmically by the authors and interwoven with the sonified micrographs, the list becomes a chemical incantation, an audible atmosphere, a choral mapping of invisible exposure. Its durational naming—stretching breath across syllables of synthetic and organic compounds—renders explicit what is often hidden in Safety Data Sheets or relegated to the footnotes of fabrication manuals. This gesture introduces chemopoetics as both a methodological stance and a speculative aesthetic for engaging with residues of contemporary fabrication. Drawing on the etymological tension between chemo- (chemical processes, often molecular and invisible) and poiesis (from the Greek ποίησις, “to make, to bring forth”), and resisting the positivist clarity of conventional data representation, chemopoetics proposes an affective, polyphonic aesthetic—where noise, repetition, and broken intelligibility are mobilized to hear what remains just outside normative perception.
**Distance Unknown: Risks and Opportunities of Migration in the Americas** — Distance Unknown presents a tapestry woven from paper currency as a physical data visualization of the financial sacrifices Central American migrants make to journey to the United States. Based on data collected with the United Nations World Food Programme and the Migration Policy Institute, the project documents that in a single year (2020–2021), migrants from El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras collectively spent $2.2 billion to migrate—resources that benefited both the U.S. and sending countries, while migrants themselves assumed all of the risk. Each square of the textile represents one migrant, with the colors of the woven bills encoding their primary reason for leaving: economic opportunity (blue), quality of life (yellow), family reunification (orange), security (purple), and climate change (green). The work was co-produced with Casa Tochan, a Mexico City–based nonprofit, and crafted with the participation of thirteen Latin American migrants. The project demonstrates how art can help foster dialogue on urgent social issues by translating complex data into tangible and aesthetic form. The research underpinning Distance Unknown has shaped international policy conversations: findings were presented to U.S. Congress through an interactive data visualization, cited in a letter signed by thirty-three U.S. senators, and contributed to the Biden Administration’s Call to Action for Northern Central America. Within the exhibition, the tapestry is paired with an interactive tool that allows visitors to explore the story of one migrant by scanning a piece of currency on a touch-sensitive reader. This link between individual testimony and collective data underscores the project’s goal: to make the human costs of migration visible, to restore agency and dignity to those most affected, and to use art as a catalyst for civic debate and policy change.
**FeltSight** — FeltSight is a mixed reality sensory-substitution experience that reimagines human perception through an alternative tactile umwelt, inspired by the star-nosed mole's unique tactile navigation. Users engage in meditative wandering guided by extended-range sensing with haptic feedback and subtle visual cues. The system features a pair of wearable haptic gloves with high-precision vibrotactile actuators on each finger, driven by audio-responsive patterns. These actuators re-sensitize the sense of touch and simulate material textures, enabling users to "feel" environmental surfaces as if their fingertips can tele-touch surrounding objects at a distance. The mixed reality headset provides a deliberately subtle "reduced reality," showing nearby objects as dynamic point clouds that serve as a "short-term perceptual memory," visualizing touched textures on surrounding surfaces. By shifting focus from visual to tactile perception, FeltSight challenges occularcentric sensory hierarchies and elevates touch as a way to perceive the world. This approach invites users to experience the umgebung---the world that exists but typically goes unperceived---through substituted perception, exemplifying tentacular thinking for more-than-human awareness.
**Romance Series: Unrequited United** — Unrequited United explores Amazon Kindle Popular Highlights in romance novels. A passage in a Kindle e-book becomes a Popular Highlight after a certain number of people independently highlight the same passage. Popular Highlights show up as underlined text along with the number of people who highlighted that passage. I expected that romance readers might highlight the smutty parts, but, surprisingly, they are predominantly highlighting passages about grief, loneliness, and trauma. These often heartbreaking passages are not the sort of thing that people would broadcast on social media. They aren’t something people are bookmarking to return to later or posting on Goodreads. The anonymity of Popular Highlights allows people to show vulnerability and empathy with feelings they might be reluctant to reveal on other social media platforms. Since 2010, I have collected thousands of Kindle Popular Highlights from romance novels into a database. Over one hundred thousand individual acts of highlighting were used to determine the content for these artworks telling the story of the intense loneliness, grief, vulnerability, and discontent felt by the readers. This work reveals a glimpse of a positive, anonymous social network emerging unintentionally through this minor Kindle feature. With this ongoing project I draw attention to this existing example of collective social support in order to change society’s vision for the future of social technologies. Unrequited United invites others to show solidarity with the anonymous highlighters by wearing Kindle Popular Highlights laser engraved onto silicone wristbands. I give people the wristband that most resonates with them in exchange for an anonymous story about love. These stories will be made into an artist’s book.
**Living Library of Trees: Mapping Knowledge Ecology in Arnold Arboretum** — As biodiversity loss and climate change accelerate, botanical gardens serve as vital infrastructures for research, education, and conservation. This project focuses on the Arnold Arboretum of Harvard University, a 281-acre living museum founded in 1872 in Boston. Drawing on more than a century of curatorial data, the research combines historical analysis with computational methods to visualize the biographies of plants and people. The resulting platform reveals patterns of care and scientific observations, along with the collective dimensions embedded in botanical data. Using techniques from artificial intelligence, geospatial mapping, and information design, the project frames the arboretum as a system of shared agency--an active archive of more-than-human affinities that records the layered memory of curatorial labor, the situated nature of knowledge production, and the potential of design to bridge archival record and future care.
**Weaving Water, Interleaving Silence** — The project Weaving Water, Interleaving Silence is an artistic research project exploring the expressiveness of water and its potential as a visualization tool for emotions that lie beneath the surface. Through strategies in data visualization, computer vision and mechatronic elements, this installation explores the translational and transdisciplinary poetics in our connection to water and its metaphors of flow, depth, and revelation. Conceptually, the artwork aligns strongly with the exhibition’s inspired notions of ‘collective care’ on various levels.  At its most immediate, Weaving Water, Interleaving Silence valorizes stories of resilience of climate disaster survivors and survivors in marginalized groups/communities, especially in cases where systemic infrastructures enact an ongoing process of silencing and devaluing of the experiences of individuals in the advent of large, global crises. At a deeper and perhaps self-critical level, the artwork contemplates the validity of computationally-enhanced emotional recognition techniques as part of a toolkit for identifying need and/or warranting care – recognizing that the reduction embedded within the processes of data collection has already been critiqued as distancing, isolating and dehumanizing.  Our proposal with this artwork is to consider elemental media as a form of affective and transcendent materiality. Water is deeply symbolic and meditative, and its ability to flow, shape shift and interleave recursively is a powerful metaphor for the project’s ideas of an embedded and hidden emotional complexity.  By putting data structures and elemental media in synergy, how might the experience of Weaving Water, Interleaving Silence simultaneously provide affect and inform about quantifiable parameters of our emotions? More broadly, how might trajectories of data visualization practices be aligned with qualitative, multi-sensorial experiences to connect people and support conversations on collective care?
**AI-Generated Images for representing Individuals – Navigating the Thin Line Between Care and Bias** — This research discusses the figurative tensions that arise when using portraits to represent individuals behind a dataset. In the broader effort to communicate European data related to depression, the Kiel Science Communication Network (KielSCN) team attempted to engage a wider audience by combining interactive data graphics with AI-generated images of people. This article examines the project’s decisions and results, reflecting on the reaction from the audience when information design incorporates figurative representations of individuals within the data.
**Balaton Borders: Data Ceramics for Ecological Reflection** — Balaton Borders transforms ecological data from Hungary’s largest freshwater lake into ceramic tableware. Each mug, jug, plate, and bowl encodes site-specific information about reedbed loss, shoreline modification, soil erosion, sedimentation, and urban expansion. Through their shapes, volumes, and material interventions, the pieces embody the disruptions affecting Lake Balaton’s fragile ecosystem. The project extends beyond objects into performative dining events, where participants share meals served on data ceramics. These gatherings highlight how commensality—the act of eating together—can foster awareness and conversation. At the table, ecological data is not only read or seen but felt, tasted through everyday rituals. Balaton Borders invites audiences to slow down and consider the entanglement of human activity and environmental fragility. It asks what happens when we bring the dysfunctions of our ecosystems to the table and share them as part of a collective experience.
**Balaton Borders Tableware** — Balaton Borders tableware physicalizes ecological data from Lake Balaton, Hungary’s largest freshwater lake, transforming it into a tactile and sensory experience. Each porcelain piece, mug, jug, deep plate, flat plate, and small plate, embeds site-specific environmental data in its form and material. The collection represents processes such as reedbed loss, shoreline modification, soil erosion, sedimentation, and urban expansion, revealing how human activity alters the lake’s fragile ecosystem. The pieces are intentionally uneasy to use: a jug too heavy to pour, a perforated mug that leaks, or a plate that tilts. These moments of disruption reflect the environmental imbalances they represent, prompting reflection through touch, movement, and shared experience. The work reimagines dining as a space for ecological storytelling, where data becomes tangible, edible, and social. Through commensality, Balaton Borders guides people to feel the stories behind the data, opening space for reflection and care toward the more-than-human world.
**The Fire We Share** — The Fire We Share proposes a care-centered, consequence-aware visualization framework for engaging with wildfire data not as static metrics, but as living archives of ecological and social entanglement. By combining plant-inspired data forms, event-based mapping, and narrative layering, the project foregrounds fire as a shared temporal condition—one that cuts across natural cycles and human systems. Rather than simplifying wildfire data into digestible visuals, The Fire We Share reimagines it as a textured, wounded archive—embodied, relational, and radically ethical.
